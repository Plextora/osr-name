# osr!name

A command line tool made in Python for the popular rhythm game "osu!" that changes the player name of a .osr file (replay file).

# Example:

Notice that in the top left corner it says "Played by haga1115".

# Example #2:

Now, notice that it's changed from "Played by haga1115" to "Played by RyuK". osr!name has changed the name! If you send the .osr file of the replay to someone else, it will stay the same.
