# osr!name

A command line tool made in Python for the popular rhythm game "osu!" that changes the player name of a .osr file (replay file).

# Example:

Notice that in the top left corner it says "Played by haga1115".

# Example #2:

Now, notice that it's changed from "Played by haga1115" to "Played by RyuK". osr!name has changed the name! If you send the .osr file of the replay to someone else, it will stay the same.

# Cool, how do I download this?

It's not that hard. But you'll need Python 3 installed and the `osrparse` library installed (you can download `osrparse` with this command: `pip install git+https://github.com/kszlim/osu-replay-parser`) All you have to do is go to the Releases page, and then click ["osrname.py"](https://github.com/Plextora/osr-name/releases/download/v1.2/osrname.pyy) to download! To run the program, cd into the directory the file was downloaded in, and run `python3 osrname.py`.
